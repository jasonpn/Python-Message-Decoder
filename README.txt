Python message decoder that takes in a text file, where each line contains a number and a word, with a hidden message. When a pyramid pattern is constructed using the words according to its number value, a message is hidden in the ending of each pyramid line. This decoder constructs the pyramid pattern using the text file input and decodes the hidden message.

Example input text file:
  3 love
  6 computers
  2 dogs
  4 cats
  1 I
  5 you

Pyramid form:
  I
  dogs love
  cats you computers

Decoded message:
  I love computers
